# Countdown timer using Javascript

This is a basic time that uses setInterval to countdown from the present moment to the desired time.

Weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds are targeted individually to provide a coherent breakdown of the remaining time.

bonus feature was a line up list that cycles a new artist each second and repeats once the list is complete

now includes feature of user entering their own date thereby setting the counter for themselves.
